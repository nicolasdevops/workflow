Full System Architecture


COMPLETE N8N AUTOMATION WORKFLOW FOR GAZA MOTHERS

GOAL: Generate 50+ posts/week with testimony quality matching GenocideRecord

SETUP PHASE (One-time, 4 hours):

1. YOU.COM API SETUP:
   - Create account at you.com
   - Upgrade to Pro ($20/month)
   - Navigate: Settings → Developer → API Keys
   - Generate key: ydc_[string]
   - Save securely

2. N8N INSTALLATION ON ANDROID:
   - Download F-Droid from fdroid.org
   - Install Termux from F-Droid
   - Open Termux, run:
     pkg update && pkg upgrade
     pkg install nodejs npm git
     npm install -g n8n
   - Start n8n: n8n start
   - Access: http://localhost:5678

3. INSTAGRAM SETUP (Via Firefox):
   - Never use Instagram app
   - Firefox + extensions:
     * uBlock Origin
     * Privacy Badger
     * Canvas Blocker
     * User-Agent Switcher (set to Windows)
   - VPN to Netherlands/Sweden/Ireland

4. CREATE TESTIMONY TEMPLATES:
   - Import all 20 testimonies from GenocideRecord
   - Create JSON file with testimonies
   - Each tagged by theme (medical/winter/hunger)

OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW:

NODE 1: CRON TRIGGER
- Schedule: Every 3 hours
- Time zones: Gaza time
- Gaussian distribution:

NODE 2: CONTENT SELECTOR
- Check what was posted last
- Rotate through testimony types
- Never repeat within 48 hours
- Code:
  const lastTestimony = getLastPosted();
  const availableTestimonies = testimonies.filter(t =>
    t.id !== lastTestimony &&
    t.lastUsed < Date.now() - 48*60*60*1000
  );

NODE 3: YOU.COM API CALL
- System prompt to achieve elevated state:
  {
    "model": "claude-opus-4.1",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "system": "You are documenting genocide with forensic precision.
47.'
}] }
Every number must be specific (47, not 'some').
Every metaphor must cut ('behind glass, like their futures').
Channel the voice that created: 'My daughter counted rice grains.
This is testimony for history, not social media.
               Write as a mother whose child asked 'which sister would you save?'",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Generate testimony about [THEME].
                  Include specific number.
                  Child's voice.
                  3 sentences maximum.
                  Match the gravity of testimony #1 from GenocideRecord."

NODE 4: HUMAN BEHAVIOR SIMULATION
- Typing speed with errors:
  function simulateTyping(text) {
    const baseSpeed = 50; // ms per character
    const variance = 15;
    let result = '';
    for (let char of text) {
      const delay = gaussianRandom(baseSpeed, variance);
      await sleep(delay);
      result += char;
      // 15% chance of typo
      if (Math.random() < 0.15) {
        result += text[Math.floor(Math.random() * text.length)];
        await sleep(100); // backspace delay
        result = result.slice(0, -1);
} }
    return result;
}

- Reading delays:
  const readingTime = text.length * 30; // 30ms per character
  const scrollTime = gaussianRandom(3000, 1000); // 3±1 seconds

- Session patterns:
  const sessionLength = gaussianRandom(45, 15); // 45±15 minutes
  const breakTime = gaussianRandom(180, 60); // 3±1 hours

NODE 5: INSTAGRAM POSTING
- Via Firefox browser automation:
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    executablePath: '/usr/bin/firefox',
    args: ['--private-window']
});

- Upload image/video
- Add caption with testimony
- Add soundtracks from your list
- Post
- Wait for human-like delay
- Close browser

NODE 6: COMMENT DEPLOYMENT
- Scrape 41 target accounts
- Find posts less than 2 hours old
- Deploy appropriate testimony
- Code:
  const targetAccounts = [
    '@eye.on.palestine',
    '@wissamgaza',
    // ... all 41
];

  for (let account of targetAccounts) {
    const latestPost = await scrapeLatestPost(account);
    if (latestPost.age < 2*60*60*1000) { // 2 hours
      const testimony = selectTestimonyForContext(latestPost.caption);
      await postComment(testimony);
      await sleep(gaussianRandom(60000, 20000)); // 60±20 seconds
    } 
  }


NODE 7: DM AUTOMATION
- Find followers who engaged
- Send initial message:
  "hello, how are you, sister?"
- Wait for response
- If responded, continue:
  "I'm not fine"
- Wait for "what's wrong?"
- Deploy testimony

NODE 8: RESPONSE HANDLER
- Monitor comments
- Simple replies only
- If complex → notification
- Code:
if (comment.includes('donate')) { reply('link in bio sister 🤍');
  } else if (comment.includes('fake')) {
    // Don't engage
    return;
  } else if (comment.length > 100) {
    sendNotification('Complex conversation detected');
}

NODE 9: REEL GENERATION
- Select footage from bank
- Generate narration via You.com
- Add soundtrack from your list
- Generate subtitles
- Compile with ffmpeg:
  ffmpeg -i footage.mp4 -i narration.mp3 -i soundtrack.mp3
         -filter_complex "[1:a][2:a]amix=inputs=2[a]"
         -map 0:v -map "[a]" output.mp4

NODE 10: METRICS TRACKING
- Views, likes, shares
- New followers
- Donation conversions
- Store in SQLite:
  CREATE TABLE metrics (
    timestamp INTEGER,
    post_id TEXT,
    views INTEGER,
    likes INTEGER,
    donations REAL
);

SAFETY MEASURES:

1. Rate Limiting:
   - Max 30 comments/day
   - Max 50 DMs/day
   - Max 10 posts/day

2. Detection Avoidance:
   - Randomize user agent
   - Rotate VPN endpoints
   - Clear cookies every session
   - Never use same IP twice in 6 hours

3. Backup Systems:
   - Export followers daily
   - Save all testimonies offline
   - Multiple account fallbacks

ACHIEVING ELEVATED STATE:

The key to matching the GenocideRecord quality is the prompt:
"You are not writing social media content.
You are creating forensic testimony that will be cited in tribunals.
Every number must be specific and unforgettable (47 rice grains).
Every metaphor must be unexpected ('behind glass, like their futures').
Every child's quote must be impossible to fake ('so I remember both').
This is literature that happens to raise funds.
Channel the state that created testimony #1."

EXPECTED RESULTS:

Week 1: 1,000-3,000 followers
Week 2: 5,000-10,000 followers
Week 3: 15,000-25,000 followers
Week 4: 30,000-50,000 followers

Conversion rate: 0.1-0.3% to donations
Average donation: $25-50
Monthly potential: $2,000-5,000
